### Updated LCDB 1.1 Features 
| Database   | Data Acquisition             | Feature Scaling | Estimation Anchor               | Learner \| Dataset  |
|------------|--------------------------|-----------------|---------------------------------|----------------------|
| **LCDB 1.0**  | with data-leakage (dl)    | none              | âŒˆ 16 â‹… 2<sup>n/2</sup> âŒ‰               | 20 \| 196  |
| **LCDB 1.1**  | with and without dl   | none, min-max, standard        | 4 times denser                 | 32 \| 265    |

### How to use the LCDB 1.1? 
First download the precomputed learning curves from [4TU.ResearchData](https://data.4tu.nl/private_datasets/V7dDlGyQJqPc_mXUAJL1MweACKG557GQtOWIVHhYpjU) and extract them to the folder [`dataset`](./dataset/). The [Readme](./dataset/README.md) in the dataset folder explains the files and their content. Or you can use the demonstration in [`LCDB11_demo.ipynb`](./LCDB11_demo.ipynb) to download the data automatically. Useful metafeatures can be found in folder [`meta_feature`](./meta_feature/). 

Note, we recommend using learning curves from validation sets, since the sets differ in each inner and outer split, to ensure a no data-leakage version. The demostration can be found in [`LCDB11_demo.ipynb`](./LCDB11_demo.ipynb). 

### Reproduce all figures from the paper
Install the packages in [`analysis/requirements.txt`](./analysis/requirements.txt). Once the setup is complete,the analysis notebooks in the [`analysis`](./analysis/) folder illustrate the usage. 

### Contact us if you need more metrics!
We have stored all the probabilistic outputs and / or scores (when available for the learner). However, these files are too large for us to host for the broader public. If you are interested in a particular metric that we do not include, please contact us and we can compute it and host it. 

### Workflow for Computing LCDB 1.1
To ensure the reproducibility, please download the [container](https://surfdrive.surf.nl/files/index.php/s/TSe0nqWKcT5jPwK) (or generate it by using  or use the [`env`](./experiments/env) to generate the same image) and follow the [instruction](./experiments/README.md) in [`experiments`](./experiments/) folder.
