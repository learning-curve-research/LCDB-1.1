# Experiment Results

Due to the experiments update, both standardization and min-max normalization use Feature Scaling = True as the setting. 

We finished all experiments on min-max scaling, and changed the code to finish the standardization part. 
We changed the numerical pipeline from minmaxscaler to standardscaler, and add one line standardscaler for categorical pipeline. (line with comment ###### standard scaling case #######)
