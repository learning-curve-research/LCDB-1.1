Learning curves are often assumed to be well-behaved: monotone (i.e. improving with more data) and convex. By constructing the Learning Curves Database 1.1, a larger scale database wither high resolution learning curves, we show that that learning curves are less often well-behaved than previously believed. Based on statistically rigorous methods, we find significant ill-behavior in approximately 14\\% of learning curves, almost twice as much as earlier estimates. We also identify which learners are to blame, and find that specific learners are more ill-behaved than others. Additionally, we find that different feature scalings rarely resolves ill-behavior. We evaluate the impact of ill-behavior on downstream tasks, such as learning curve fitting and model selection, and find it poses significant challenges, emphasizing the relevance of ill-behaving curves, and underscores the challenging nature of our newly proposed learning curve database.\"\n",

They are useful for studying scaling laws and speeding up hyperparameter tuning and model selection. Learning curves are often assumed to be well-behaved: monotone (i.e. improving with more data) and convex. By constructing the Learning Curves Database 1.1, a larger scale database wither high resolution learning curves, we show that that learning curves are less often well-behaved than previously believed. Based on statistically rigorous methods, we find significant ill-behavior in approximately 14\\\\% of learning curves, almost twice as much as earlier estimates. We also identify which learners are to blame, and find that specific learners are more ill-behaved than others. Additionally, we find that different feature scalings rarely resolves ill-behavior. We evaluate the impact of ill-behavior on downstream tasks, such as learning curve fitting and model selection, and find it poses significant challenges, emphasizing the relevance of ill-behaving curves, and underscores the challenging nature of our newly proposed learning curve database.\",\n",
